# complexity_neglect_pred
 Code for the manuscript "Humans neglect Occam's razor in predictive model selection". The authors are Shuze Liu*, Yang Xiang(, and Samuel J. Gershman. Here, * denotes equal contribution.

- **Bold** words are .py, .ipynb, and .sh filenames.
- *Italicized* words are .csv and .pickle filenames or directory folder names.

The code runs on Python 3.9.5 and Numpy 2.0.2.

## Online experiments

## *Experiment* folder
- It contains the Javascript code for the experiment links above.

## *Simulations* folder
- It contains code for generating experimental stimuli: **dataset_gen_largenoise.ipynb** and **dataset_gen_smallnoise.ipynb**.

## *Analysis* folder
- **manuscript_allfigures_submission.ipynb** creates all figures for the manuscript, based on the human data and the saved model fit files.
- **parse_datafiles.ipynb** converts raw, participant-specific datafiles to files seen in the *data* subfolder.
- Other **.py** and **.sh** files are definitions and clusting .sh files for fitting the Null, Coarse, and Fine models. 

### *data* subfolder
- It contains raw human data for each experiment, in both .csv and .pickle formats.
- The file *df_allsimtrials.pickle* is too large for the Github repository. See OSF project for the file. 

### *fig* subfolder
- It contains all figures generated by **manuscript_allfigures_submission.ipynb** above.

### *modelfits* subfolder
- It contains saved files for HMC model fits, and their model comparison result.
- The files *glme_numpyro_2000_2000_coarse_seed0.pickle*, *..._full_...*, and *..._null_...* are too large for the Github repository. See OSF project for the files.
